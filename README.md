# Fitness app

![screen shot of the fitness app](./screenshot.png)
This is a simple app for someone interested in fitness. Inspired by a popular fitness program located in the United States,
this app gives you the ability to customize a fitness workout. For example, the workout included consists of 3 groups of
exercises, each repeated 3 times. In total, you'll do 27 sets of exercises (9 total exercises repeated 3 times each). 
There are 3 water breaks that last 1 minute each, and 20 seconds between each exercise to prepare for the next one.

For example:
- 40 seconds for exercise #1
- 20 seconds of rest (or prepare for next exercise)
- 40 seconds for exercise #2
- 20 seconds of rest
- 40 seconds for exercise #3

There are three rounds of this with water breaks in between each. Each round has different exercises.

Things to be aware of:
- Not mobile first. The app was intended to run on a laptop so it's easy to see the timer while exercising.
- Exercises can be configured in the `./data/exercises.js` file.
- Doesn't follow best practices for React. This was a quick and dirty solution.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
